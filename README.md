## How Edits Are Stored

pyNegative is fully non-destructive. Your original images are never modified. All adjustments are stored in lightweight JSON sidecar files inside a hidden `.pyNegative` directory next to your images:

```
/Photos/
├── IMG_0001.CR3
├── IMG_0002.CR3
└── .pyNegative/
    ├── IMG_0001.CR3.json      # Edit settings
    ├── IMG_0002.CR3.json
    └── thumbnails/            # Cached thumbnails for fast loading
        ├── IMG_0001.CR3.1738000000.400.webp
        └── IMG_0001.CR3.1738000000.400.json
```
